# dat110-202402-jh

This repo stores exercise files for DAT 110.

## Process to synchronize

1. Copy the exercise file (NOT the key file) and any required data files from the "ex" folder in the main `dat110` repo over to the "ex" folder in the JH repo (this one).
2. Stage the files using `git add -A`
3. Commit changes using `git commit -am "Added class activity"`
4. When ready, use `git push` to send the files up to the remote, ideally 15-30 minutes before class starts.

When students access RStudio using the link on the course website (or `go.davidson.edu/csc110-jupyter`), the files will be automatically pulled from the GitHub repo via nbgitpuller, and students can find them in their R workspace.
